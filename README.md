# 1-GPON_DBA
This is an event-driven simulation of dynamic bandwidth allocation (DBA) in 1.244 Gbps Gigabit Passive Optical Network (GPON) following ITU-T standard. Note that this is a conceptual implementation of the MAC mainly for academic insights. So most PHY layer and detailed MAC layer features are implemented with abstraction.
